## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dr. Puccetti

### I am a psychologist with rigorous research training ('about me' below) & and I'd like to help you learn about data science!

#

### Here are a few _general_ details about what I'd like to offer. 
#### This is using R/R Studio as an example, but as you'll see below, there are definitely other topics we can cover.
- **First, brief 30m Intro**: We can meet each other, hear about your goals, hear about any experience you have, you can feel out if you like me enough to work with me, and we can set a rough plan for our work together etc.
- **Then, for those with little to no experience**: I hope to start people who are new to R in a very small group setting where we can go through the basics of R together and you can benefit from hearing others' questions, ideas, and challenges
- **For those with some experience under their belt**: Tailored, individual sessions covering the topics you are most interested in! I can provide tutoring to supplement an existing learning structure/course or teach you from the ground up. We can develop a specific project start to finish or explore different applications. Really whatever your needs are in the data science space in psychology and related fields, I can help.

### We can work on a wide range of topics:
#### **R (and MATLAB)**
-   Introductory programming and data types (vectors, data frames, etc.)
-   Data wrangling and cleaning
-   Basic plotting (with ggplot2)
-   Complex visualization
-   Statistical models
-   a bunch of others things
#### **Beyond this... I am more than happy to talk other areas of my expertise!**
-   Conceptual and technical skills in fMRI data analysis
-   Conceptual and teachincal skills in statistics for psychological science
-   Writing feedback and editting for research manuscripts and/or application materials
-   General mentorship about clinical psychology, pursuing a PhD, building a research program etc.
  
### Timing:
- **Sessions Offered**: 30m/60m/90m sessions; will almost certainly be over Zoom/Teams
- **Frquency**: Flexible to your needs (weekly, biweekly, as needed etc.) 
  - Will mostly be scheduled weeknights and weekends (EST) but again, there is flexibility to meet your needs
### Cost:
- **Pay-What-You-Can/Sliding Scale**: I aim to meet people where they are at. I totally get that cost can be really prohibitive and I am open to discussing and deciding together what will work for you. I really love teaching and mentoring and I do not want to put up more barriers to access than already exist. I do want to cover my time/effort on average across this whole endeavor though, so let's just talk! 
#### In the future, I would like to offer package discounts and incentives such as referral discount/program but these are not currently in place

### About Me: 
###### My name is Nikki and I have my PhD in clinical psychology. I earned my degree from an R1 university in the summer of 2023 and have an active research program in clinical affective neuroscience/fMRI. I am currently working as a post-doc and putting together an NIH grant. I have 10 publications (5 first author) in reputable journals & have not _completely_ lost my sanity or love of science yet! I call that a win.
###### I love teaching R and I love mentoring in all regards. These are aspects of academia that have brought me consistent joy. I have taught many undergraduate and graduate students one-on-one, in small groups, and in full classrooms as well as in-person and virtually. I have experience teaching trainees in psychology techincal skills in R, MATLAB, fMRI software (AFNI, SPM etc.) as well as broader research skills like reading articles, academic/research writing, study design, presenting, and much more.
###### I've received extensive training in psychotherapy, primarily in CBT and mindfulness-based interventions. So we can chat about that (this is not however an invite to message about your personal mental health).
###### I am also a human. I have two cattos, love board games, and want to hike more.
